N.B : 

1-Game Server and Strategy Game Project V1 are 2 seperate java projects ,so download and import each one seperatley 
on eclipse or your prefered IDE

2-Unfortunetly due to running out of time to finish the project the user city in the game was made explicitly on 
a 1920 x 1080 resolution computer and most of the components were placed using a null layout which made it not 
appear correctly on non 1920 x 1080 resolution computers ,other than that the rest of the game
appears correctly on any resolution
